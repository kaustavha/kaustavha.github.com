Personal site. 

This is based off of my JSC project:
https://github.com/kaustavha/jade-stylus-coffeescript-seed

## Steps:
From the command line, navigate to the main directory and run, prepend a sudo as you see fit.  
```
npm install
gulp
```

## Update resume to public
This site uses git submodules. Here's a quickie to update the free github site in case i forget
```
npm run save
```
