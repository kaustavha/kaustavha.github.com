Each\nsection describes a built-in module or high-level concept.\n\n</p>\n<p>Where appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments\nprovided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic\nheading.\n\n</p>\n<p>Every <code>.html</code> document has a corresponding <code>.json</code> document presenting\nthe same information in a structured manner.  This feature is\nexperimental, and added for the benefit of IDEs and other utilities that\nwish to do programmatic things with the documentation.\n\n</p>\n<p>Every <code>.html</code> and <code>.json</code> file is generated based on the corresponding\n<code>.markdown</code> file in the <code>doc/api/</code> folder in luvit&#39;s source tree.  The\ndocumentation is generated using the <code>tools/doc/generate.js</code> program.\nThe HTML template is located at <code>doc/template.html</code>.\n\n</p>\n<p>There&#39;s also a lot of examples in this <a href=\"https://github.com/luvit/luvit/tree/master/examples\">repo</a> that may be helpful.  \n</p>\n"
