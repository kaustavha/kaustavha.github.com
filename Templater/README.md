Angular-seed-app 
====================
Everything I wrote is in scripts.js. 
Basically what it does is:

>>Read content-editable section for user input

>>Create models e.g xx from var-xx 

>>Create inputs for these models and bind model views in place of var-xx occurences

>>Parse everything into second container

>>Hide first container 

TODO: save function, pdf handling, higher-order input handling like job descr./linkedIn pages
