Building this site: 
I like github, therefore, It's built on top of github pages. 

cd kaustavha.github.com
git branch rebuild && checkout rebuild
rm -r *

And we have a nice clean folder to play around in.
We'll be using brunch to build. You can download it at brunch.io. 
Alternatively, we could use yeoman, but I like the opinionated build stacks of brunch better.
Pick a suitable skeleton, I went with one using coffeeScript, jade and angular. 

brunch new https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed website

You can also just git clone the repo: 
git clone https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed.git

And we have a new directory to work in. 
cd into it and run

sudo ./scripts/init.sh
bower install
./scripts/server.sh

And navigate to http://localhost:3333

Alright, now that we have the scaffolding set up, we can get to work.
