//- p Howdy! My name's Kaustav Haldar and I'm a software developer currently living in Canada. I've been programming seriously since 2012 and have built websites, web & mobile apps and had the opportunity to explore data science and work on massive distributed systems. I've also sent a myriad of patches and features to open source projects. I've worked as an intern, freelancer, volunteer & founder. 

//- p I am in the process of finishing a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Waterloo, possibly with a minor in Cognitive Science. I also had the privilege of founding a startup (Sparkgig) and organizing a massive hackathon (Hack The North 2014) during my undegraduate career. 

p My programming interests include front end & full stack development for web, mobile or desktop apps, cryptocurrencies, data science, machine learning via neural nets & distributed systems. My non-programming interests include psychology, neuroscience, endocrinology, pharmacology & excercise science.
