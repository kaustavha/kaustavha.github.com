h1 F.A.Q

+QA('Can I x?')
	p yes

+QA('Can I copy this site?')
	p Certainly! I copied the design myself from 
		a(href='http://peteramende.de/') Peter Amende's
		|  site while helping a friend use his Ghost Theme. You can find all the source files on github 
		a(href='https://github.com/kaustavha/kaustavha.github.com') here.
		|  There's a lot of folders there you don't need since I also use the free static hosting to host other things like old projects. Taking a look at this simplified seed project 
		a(href='https://github.com/kaustavha/jade-stylus-coffeescript-seed') here
		|  might help you understand which files and folders you need. The site is mainly written in jade and stylus, using gulp for transpilation and development. 

+QA('Why a Psychology degree if you like coding so much?')
	p I initially joined Management Engineering in 2012 and quickly became disenfranchised with the subject material and realized it wasn't what I was expecting to learn. I managed to land a co-op job as a frontend web developer and realized I really enjoyed programming. When I came back to school I decided to take a while to try different classes and programs so as not to make the same mistake of enrolling in a program I disliked again. 
	p My brain thinks the human brain is really interesting, kinda narcissistic of it eh? I decided to study Psychology mainly because it interested me, and I was afraid enrolling in CS would leave me disenfranchised with an activity I really enjoyed (programming). I believe education should be enjoyable and well-rounded, not merely directed at making you a better cog in someone elses machine.
	p I also believe my degree is an asset as it helps me understand people, and help create more cohesive and collaborative work environments as well as better teach and onboard new developers. Good software is not written in a vacuum. 
	p We also see a trend of increasing use of AI in this industry and my education on the human brain gives me a unique perspective in this world. Although some things are believed to have no biological correlates, such as backpropagation, the theories did still initially inherit from the fields of Neuroscience and Cognitive Science. 

+QA('Can I hire you?')
	p Yes! I'm currently looking for a job. I'm open to internships, positions anywhere in the world, full time roles & contract work. 

+QA('Will you work for free/exposure/equity? What about a trial period with backpay or pro-bono for a non-profit?')
	p As a student with student loans I unfortunately cannot accept any unpaid opportunities. But you can still email me if you're looking for advice or want to chat. 

+QA('Do you do consulting? Can I ask you some questions about X?')
	p Yes, email me! If it lines up with my interests I'm more than happy to talk about it! Nothing I say constitutes medical advice. 

+QA("What's up with the other interests?")
	p I've always been a curious kid. And I support sane practical transhumanism. Towards that goal of improving the quality of life and life expectancy of humans I try to educate myself on what we know of the human mind and body so far. I also think that the person that cares the most about your wellbeing is yourself, and it's foolish to completely and blindly trust doctors with your health. Although I believe there is always a disconnect between academia and industry or practical current applications, the primary sources of information in this space should be academic papers from reputable journals. I think most people can form a rudimentary understanding of their body and mind and use it to improve their health and performance. I also spent some time as an editor & founder for an online nootropics magazine. 

+QA("Can you elaborate more on your startup/founder/entrepreneurial experiences?")
	p I had the privilege of being admitted into the Velocity program at UWaterloo in my second term. Velocity is a residence/incubator for entreprenurial students. Through this I learned a lot about startups which cumulated in me joining the founding team of a music industry startup called 
		a(href='https://angel.co/sparkgig') Sparkgig.
		|  I was one of 3 founding developers who built the entire web application using the M.E.A.N stack, additionally I also helped source talented musicians and customers. I stayed there for a little under a year eventually realizing my learning had stagnated and left to seek out new opportunities. We won $25k at the Velocity Fund Finals at UWaterloo among other business competitions, and I was kindly given a nice severance package for my foundational work. The startup continued to exist for another 2 or 3 years. 
	p Apart from that I've also freelanced at a couple startups in Toronto building mobile apps & pitched completed projects at hackathons numerous times. 
	p I was also a founding editor at a nootropics information website called 
		a(href='https://nootropix.com/') nootropix.com
		|  where I recruited writers, edited work, and wrote research-backed & primer articles about neuroscience and pharmacology. I spent a little less than 4 months here when a messy founder dispute situation and my full-time work responsibilities forced me to quit. 

+QA("Can you elaborate more on your organizational experiences?")
	p I was the Logistics Director for the first Hack the North event at the University of Waterloo in 2014. Hack the North is a Major League Hacking sponsored event with 1000+ hackers showing up, it is recurring and occurs in September. At that inaugaural event we had notable judges & speakers like Sam Altman (President@YCombinator), Chamath Palihapitiya (VC@Social Capital) & Vitalik Buterin (Founder@Ethereum). 
	p My responsibilities included laying the groundwork for the event by sourcing food, sleeping accomodation, triaging with Campus IT for internet and power lines, with Campus Emergency Response in case of serious accidents, setting up and laying out furniture for the hackers in compliance with fire safety regulations, co-ordinating volunteer efforts to keep the event functioning smoothly and dealing with hiccups in the plan the day of. I'm grateful to have had the support of the Engineering events organizer, Kathi Griffiths, the volunteers at HTN and the rest of the organizing & fundraising team. 
	p I also had the chance to help organize a conference during my internship at Rackspace, RAX.IO 2016. My main responsibility was to coordinate volunteer efforts for the various roles, and reach out to colleagues recruiting for said roles. 
	p A more minor organization role I held was the Social Comittee Chair at my housing cooperative, 
		a(href='https://www.wcri.coop/') WCRI.
		|  During my 8 month tenure on the comittee I helped organize a bit over a dozen events with a budget of $500 per 4 month term. 

+QA("Tell us about your open source work")
	p I got to work on an open source monitoring tool while at Rackspace.
