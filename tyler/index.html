As time passes, they each uncover dark secrets about each other about where they're going and where they're coming from. As the truths they discover become more ridiculous and alarming, the dream of eventually boarding the airplane becomes nothing more than a distant fantasy. Finally, each passenger must face a difficult choice; and in the end, only one of them will have the opportunity to experience what it's truly like to fly in the clouds.</p><br><a href="">Click to watch</a></div><div class="info"><p>Gate Seventeen (Boarding Soon)" draws its inspiration from the works of Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Classic absurdist theatre is re-imagined and brought into the brave new world of the 21st century. </p><br><p>The journey is both wildly funny and carefully poignant, crafted by such classic theatre as "Waiting for Godot", "The Homecoming", and "Endgame".
