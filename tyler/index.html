Classic absurdist theatre is re-imagined and brought into the brave new world of the 21st century. </p></div><div class="synopsis"><h2>Synopsis:<hr></h2><br><p>A variety of passengers meet in a large, sprawling airport at the crack of dawn, awaiting to board their flight to Vancouver. As time passes, they each uncover dark secrets about each other about where they're going and where they're coming from. As the truths they discover become more ridiculous and alarming, the dream of eventually boarding the airplane becomes nothing more than a distant fantasy. Finally, each passenger must face a difficult choice; and in the end, only one of them will have the opportunity to experience what it's truly like to fly in the clouds.</p></div><div class="info"><p>The journey is both wildly funny and carefully poignant, crafted by such classic theatre as "Waiting for Godot", "The Homecoming", and "Endgame". Full of unbelievable and hilarious characters, classic Vaudeville routines, and moments of unthinkable and extreme horror, "Gate Seventeen (Boarding Soon)" is a show like nothing you ever imagined.  </p></div><div class="cast-holder"><h2>The Cast:<hr></h2><div class="left"><ul class="cast"><li>Ian...........TO BE ANNOUNCED</li><hr/><li>Lizzie......TO BE ANNOUNCED</li><hr/><li>Cody.......Christopher Hemming</li><hr/><li>Mombo Monster....Antony Discenza</li><hr/><li>Gertrude....Sam Bogart</li><hr/><li>Rachel....Maddy Heys</li><hr/><li>The Captain....Lucas DeLuca</li><hr/></ul></div><div class="right"><ul class="cast"><li>Written by....Tyler Collins</li><hr/><li>Stage Manager....Sandy Thi</li><hr/><li>Costume Design....Sarah Beattie</li><hr/><li>Scenic Design....Tyler Collins</li><hr/><li>Web/graphic Design....Kaustav Haldar</li><hr/><li>Theatre Manager (QEPT)...Lori Coletta</li><hr/><li>Directed by....Tyler Collins</li><hr/></ul></div></div><div class="info"><p>Produced in Participation with Queen Elizabeth Park Theatre, MCAT Gems, Kickstarter, Folkmanis Puppets, Tyler Collins, and The Town of Oakville.      </p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d2898.6489658525757!2d-79.718583!3d43.405266!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x882b5de013597939%3A0xf8876f454634ac62!2sQueen+Elizabeth+Park+Community+and+Cultural+Centre!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1396335541243" width="95%" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0; margin: 2.5%"></iframe></div><script src="./assets/scripts.js"></script></body><footer><p>Crafted from Jade with a stylus, by Kaustav(gh|fb:kaustavha) for Tyler(fb:tyler.collins.5243).
