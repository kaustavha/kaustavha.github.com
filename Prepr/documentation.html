<body style="left: 100%, right: 100%"><h1>Prepr Tagapp</h1><p>This document provides an overview of the prepr tag app mobile application. </p><p>The application is meant to be able to scan QR codes and render associated content on a smart TV</p><p>The application is segregated into three main parts. </p><ol><li>Mobile application</li><li>Prepr platform</li><li>Server responsible for rendering views on the TV and keeping a record of QR code key values</li></ol><h2>1. Mobile Application Views</h2><p>The mobile application has 4 main views.</p><ul><li>Login</li><li>Barcode Scanner</li><li>History</li><li>Dashboard</li></ul><p>The login page is shown to new users of the application and acts </p>as an access portal. Authentication was handled by posting user input to the wordpress site, then inspecting the response.<p>The barcode scanner consists of the cordova camera API and a java zxing library included into the project. </p>The page consists of a button to scan barcodes, and selection options for different content types for the barcodes. <p>The history page lists the content of previously scanned codes and their scanned dates. </p><p>The dashboard page acts as an iframe to the online dashboard/content/control panel available at the Prepr main site for authenticated users.</p><h2>2. Server Architecture</h2><p>The mobile application relies on the existence of two external service servers. </p><ol><li>Prepr main site/ prepr wordpress site</li><li>Barcode key-value database and API</li></ol><p>1. The main prepr platform is used for user authentication and as a content source for the dashboard view. </p><p>2. The barcode key-value db and api stores corresponding data for keys stored in the barcodes and renders requested data.</p>It consists of three views.<ul><li>TV name registration page</li><li>Empty template view</li><li>Rendered template view</li></ul><p>The user first goes to the TV name registration page at url say www.prepr.com/tv</p><p>On registering a TV name the empty template view is loaded.</p><p>The user enters their TV name and scans a QR code.</p><p>On a server API access event i.e. a POST to the server, the data associated with the scanned QR code key is rendered. This data can be anything from a URL (e.g. youtube videos) to text content.</p><p>On subsequent QR code scans the server destroys its current rendered template and renders the newly sent data. </p><h2>3. Technical Overview</h2><h3>1. Prepr platform/main site</h3><p>Unknown, most likely PHP, not much control over the source code. </p><h3>2. API server, QR code key value DB</h3><p>The server is written in plain javascript and uses Express for the server and APIs. The database is PostgreSQL and consists of two columns, key and value.</p><p>The code is currently available opensourced on Github on the accounts of Walter Miller and Kaustav Haldar. The tested deployment exists only on a heroku node owned by W. Miller.</p><h3>3. Mobile application</h3><p>The mobile application is written using an old version of Cordova. It is written in modern web technologies namely HTML, CSS and JS. It leverages:</p><ul><li>Cordova barcodescanner API for scanning QR codes</li><li>Localstorage for history</li><li>jQmobile for UI and structure</li></ul><h2>4. Process</h2><p>The process involved in using the app: </p><ol><li>User opens app on phone</li><li>Logs in using their prepr credentials</li><li>The app checks that the user is registered with Prepr </li><li>User starts TV, navigates to the servers view page, e.g. www.prepr.com/tv</li><li>Selects/enters a TV name of their choosing</li><li>The TV browsers redirects to a empty template viewing page e.g. www.prepr.com/tv/example where example was the selected TV name</li><li>User enters the TV name on the mobile app</li><li>Scans a QR code</li><li>The mobile application sends a HTTP POST request with the key encoded in the QR code and the selected TV name to the server e.g {name: 'example', item: '1'} or in url form "www.prepr.com/tv/:tv_id/item/:item_id"</li><li>The server searches the DB for the received key and renders the associated content into the view. I.E www.prepr.com/tv/example would start playing a youtube video at this point if we assumed we have '1': 'someYoutubeUrl' in the DB</li><li>The mobile application creates an independent frame within pointing at the server view rendered on the TV though it can be configured to point to a different view or allow control of the TV view. </li></ol><h3>Data flow diagram</h3><img src="./imgs/dataflow.jpg"/><h2>5.
